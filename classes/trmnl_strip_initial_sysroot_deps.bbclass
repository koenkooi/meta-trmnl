# Strips *-initial do_populate_sysroot nodes (e.g. libgcc-initial,
# glib-2.0-initial) out of BB_TASKDEPDATA before oe-core's
# extend_recipe_sysroot runs, on every task of the inheriting recipe that
# would otherwise receive it.
#
# Root cause: any task whose [depends] flag contains the substring
# "populate_sysroot" gets extend_recipe_sysroot auto-attached as a prefunc
# (staging.bbclass, staging_taskhandler). That function walks the task's full
# BB_TASKDEPDATA to build a per-recipe sysroot. The "-initial" bootstrap
# providers (used only to build glibc, fully superseded by their real
# counterparts afterwards) are normally kept out of a sysroot by
# setscene_depvalid()'s SSTATE_EXCLUDEDEPS_SYSROOT filtering - but that
# filtering only fires when the *consuming* task is itself do_populate_sysroot
# (sstate.bbclass), which is never true for do_image_oci, do_image_complete,
# do_install, do_package, etc. So both an "-initial" provider and its real
# counterpart get exposed into the same sysroot and collide on a shared file
# (crtbegin.o, gunixinputstream.h, ...), aborting the task while every other
# tool involved reports success.
#
# oe-core's own staging_populate_sysroot_dir (a different, shared-sysroot
# codepath) already skips "-initial" manifests for exactly this reason
# ("skip libgcc-initial due to file overlap"); this class gives the
# per-recipe extend_recipe_sysroot path the same treatment, scoped to
# whichever recipe inherits it.
#
# Use: `inherit trmnl_strip_initial_sysroot_deps` in any recipe whose tasks
# pull in a full toolchain/library closure (e.g. via a do_image_complete or
# similar dependency) without needing that closure's own build-time sysroot
# content.
